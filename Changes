Revision history for Module-Starter-Plugin-CGIApp

0.05    Thu Sep 27 02:16:22 EDT 2008
        Added cgiapp_starter script thanks to Mark Stosberg 
        <mark@summersault.com>
        
        Building with Module::Install and ExtUtils::MakeMaker should work 
        properly now.
        
        Added some tests so we can check if the modules we are building are 
        actually complete.

        Removed cvsignore from the default templates.
        
        Generated distributions will now include a CGI::Application::Server 
        script to use as a development server.

        Generated distributions no longer require Test::Builder.
        
        Added a set of templates that use Titanium instead of CGI::Application.
        Also added titanium-starter which works like cgiapp-starter but uses 
        the Titanium templates.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        Creating modules that use ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Install
        is probably buggy.  Please send bug reports and patches.
